# PrintDemo
Experiment for printing and archiving files in a folder
Make sure you wire up the directories to your desired directories

```jacksta.source.dir=< files to be printed are located>
jacksta.destination.dir=<the archive folder for the files after printing>
jacksta.temp.dir=<temp dir for merging files and doing one print job>
```
